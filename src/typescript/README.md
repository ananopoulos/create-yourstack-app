If you would like to support typescript-centric projects:
* Remove this README.md file
* Copy the directories and files from the 'javascript' directory into the 'typescript' directory
* Modify the files as needed to support typescript in each of the dependencies
* Modify the 'npm.json' file to install any additional dependencies
* Remove the 'typescript not supported' check in /bin/index.js
* Remove the 'typescript not supported' message in the 'yargs' configuration in /bin/index/js'
* Test, test, test!
